# About

## Who We Are

We are neighbors who formed a tenant association
because we have the impression that many of us face similar experiences in our day-to-day life here.
We want to understand our rights,
strengthen our community,
and express our shared interests in a respectful, constructive way.

## What Matters to Us

### Fair and equal treatment
We believe that laws and protections for tenants should apply equally to everyone.
We sometimes have the impression that some aspects of rental regulations can be difficult to understand in everyday life,
and we aim to seek clarity where needed.
Our goal is simply to seek clarity, fairness, and dialogue, and to ensure our rights are respected as intended.

### A well-maintained home
Many residents have noticed issues such as weak insulation, recurring dirt in common areas, or elevators that do not always function properly.
Living here feels like these are areas where improvements could make everyday life more comfortable and safer for everyone.

### Responsible and transparent use of our rent
We sometimes feel that more focus on the everyday needs of residents would make life here more comfortable.
We would like to encourage a stronger focus on maintenance and on the well-being of the people who live and work here.
Our wish is simply that our contributions help support a stable, healthy living environment.

### A caring and supportive community
We want this house to be a place where people feel at home, not just a place they pass through.
We believe life is better when neighbors can rely on each other,
share experiences,
and create a positive atmosphere.
Our association helps connect residents,
exchange information,
and strengthen our sense of community.

## Our Vision

A house where people feel welcome.  
A building that is cared for.  
A community that stands together.  
A home we are proud of.
