# Welcome to Our Tenant Community

We are a group of neighbors who care about creating a warm, welcoming, and well-maintained home for everyone in our building.
Over time,
we have shared experiences,
exchanged impressions,
and learned that many of us want similar things:
a comfortable home,
fair treatment,
and a strong sense of community.

Our initiative focuses on bringing residents together to talk openly,
offer help,
and work constructively toward shared goals.
Whether it's
exchanging information about tenant rights,
discussing building concerns,
or organizing small social moments,
we believe that good neighbors make life better.

We invite everyone in the house to participate,
share their impressions,
and help shape a home where people feel
valued,
heard,
and connected.

## Upcoming Meetings

We have another meeting planned on December 15th 2025. We invited a lawyer from the Berlin Tenant Association to talk about the utility bill. You can find more infos [here](nebenkosten.html).
